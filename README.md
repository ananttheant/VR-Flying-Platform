# VR Flying Platform
Greetings Wanderer!
You've stumbled upon a VR experience where can you just sit back, put on your HMD and experience a flying platform moving to predefiend destinations over a low-poly world, with just simple input you can stop the platform at any point to take sink-in the view.

# Releases
You can find the application in the release for the following platform:
1. Cardboard Andriod
2. GearVr
3. Oculus Rift
4. HTC Vive, and other OpenVR Compatible devices

# Extra
If you're a lazy developer like me and don't always feel like pluging in you HMD, i've added a tool, to move the camera when you keep pressing right Mouse Button and drag it(Only Works in Editor). 

And the left mouse to move and stop the platform.
